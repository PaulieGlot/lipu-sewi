The translation process begins when a <b>Translator</b> decides to submit an initial translation for a verse. In this situation, they navigate to the channel in the Discord server and check to see whether a thread has been opened yet for that verse. If not, the translator opens a new thread for the verse and sends their initial translation in the thread.

Upon seeing that a new initial translation has been put forth, a <b>Proofreader</b> and an appropriate <b>Biblical Language Specialist</b> join the thread to revise the translation, forming a <b>Translation Crew</b>. The <b>Biblical Language Specialist</b> makes sure that the translation matches the original text as closely as possible, while the <b>Proofreader</b> makes sure that the translation is understandable according to toki pona grammar.

Once a translation has been approved and sealed by a <b>Translator</b>, a <b>Proofreader</b>, and an appropriate <b>Biblical Language Specialist</b>, it is finalised. Finalised verses are periodically added to the repo by trusted individuals.
