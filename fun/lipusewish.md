## Grammatical peculiarities

### The ge- (-t) prefix

This is a borrowed element of Yiddish and German grammar that occurs occasionally in Lipusewish. This was originally noticed with the verb "githubbed", which was eventually reanalysed as "ge-thubbed" by analogy with a common German and Yiddish past participle form, thus also creating the verb "thub". The ge- prefix is now productive, and is sometimes accompanied with the suffix -t such as in "gefixt", "gesealt", and "gelangspect".
